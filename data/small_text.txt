This is a small test file for string matching algorithms.
We will search for patterns in this text.
The naive algorithm should find all occurrences of patterns.
Patterns can appear multiple times in the text.
Let's try some repeating patterns like "algorithm algorithm algorithm".
Some patterns overlap, like in "abababa" the pattern "aba" appears multiple times.
The KMP algorithm uses preprocessed information to avoid redundant comparisons.
Boyer-Moore uses smart skipping techniques to improve efficiency.
Rabin-Karp utilizes hashing to quickly identify potential matches.
Each algorithm has different strengths depending on the text and pattern characteristics.
