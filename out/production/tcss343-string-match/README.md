## String Matching Algorithms Comparison

### Project Purpose  
This project implements and compares four classic string matching algorithms to analyze their performance characteristics across different pattern types and text sizes. The goal is to understand when each algorithm performs best in practice, beyond what theoretical time complexity analysis alone would suggest.

---

### Implemented Algorithms

- **Naive Algorithm**: The straightforward character-by-character comparison approach that checks each possible position in the text.  
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: Utilizes a preprocessed partial match table to avoid redundant comparisons and backtracking.  
- **Boyer-Moore**: Implements the bad character heuristic to skip portions of the text, searching from right to left.  
- **Rabin-Karp**: Uses a rolling hash function to quickly identify potential matches before character-by-character verification.  

All algorithms implement the same `StringMatcher` interface, ensuring consistent testing and fair comparison.

### Running the Tests

#### Setup:
- Clone this repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/Linda-Miao/tcss343-string-match.git`
- Ensure that JDK 21 or later is installed
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE

#### Prepare test data:
- Test data files are located in the `data/` directory  
- To create new tests, add additional text files to this directory

#### Run the comparison tests:
- Execute the `TextLoaderTest` class to run all comparisons  
- For individual algorithm testing, the `main` method may be modified to specify patterns or texts

### Key Findings

The comprehensive testing revealed several important insights:

- **Character Comparisons**: Rabin-Karp consistently performed the fewest character comparisons (often 90–95% fewer than Naive), with Boyer-Moore ranking second.
- **Execution Time**: Despite performing more comparisons, the Naive algorithm often achieved the fastest execution times for shorter patterns due to its simplicity and lack of preprocessing overhead.
- **Pattern Length Impact**: Both Boyer-Moore and Rabin-Karp improved dramatically in efficiency as pattern length increased, while Naive and KMP maintained relatively constant performance.

### Best Use Cases

- **Naive**: Best for short patterns or small texts  
- **KMP**: Suitable when consistent, predictable performance is required  
- **Boyer-Moore**: Excellent for long patterns in large texts  
- **Rabin-Karp**: Ideal for multi-pattern searching scenarios

### Practical vs. Theoretical  
The empirical results demonstrated that theoretical time complexity does not always predict practical performance, highlighting the importance of implementation factors and pattern characteristics.
